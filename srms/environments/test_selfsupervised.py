"""Assert that no training path can see ground truth.

Every method in this repo is self-supervised: a solver may read the *scene* (``slowness``, ``sdf``,
obstacle geometry), the *analytic* base geodesic, and its own collocation samples — but never the
fast-marching field, which exists only to score the result afterwards.

That is easy to state and easy to violate by accident, so it is checked three ways rather than
asserted:

1. **Static.** No module under ``srms/methods`` may mention ``ground_truth`` at all.
2. **Interface.** Each strategy's ``solve`` is walked for every ``env.<attr>`` it touches, and the
   union must lie inside an allow-list of self-supervised quantities.
3. **Dynamic.** ``env.ground_truth`` is monkeypatched to raise, then a short solve is run on every
   strategy x manifold pair. If any of them reaches for it, the run dies.

Run: ``python -m srms.environments.test_selfsupervised`` (exit code 1 on any violation).

The third check is the one that would have caught the real incident this guards against: a solver
being handed ground truth through a callback rather than referencing it by name.
