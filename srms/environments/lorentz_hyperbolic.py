"""H^n environment (n-dim hyperboloid, Lorentz/hyperboloid model, embedded in Minkowski R^{n,1}).

STATUS (see ``hyperbolic_TODO.md``): steps 1-5, i.e. all of it — geometry primitives
(``_lorentz_frame``, ``geodesic``, ``log_map``/``log_map_ambient``, ``jac_factor``,
``metric_inv``), obstacles/slowness, volume-correct sampling, manifold-projection utilities
(``sdf``, ``slowness``, ``sample_domain``, ``wrap_point``, ``displacement_np``,
``boundary_ring_np``), registration in ``ENVIRONMENTS``/``srms/run.py``, the geodesic-polar
grid/fast-marching ground truth (``grid``, ``ground_truth``, ``_fast_marching_hyperbolic``) at
n=2, and Poincaré-disk rendering (``render_grid_xy``, ``render_marker_deg``, wired into
``srms/viz.py``'s curvilinear ``pcolormesh`` path via ``srms/run.py``'s duck-typed dispatch) —
``--environment hyperbolic --method eikonal`` trains at any ``--dim`` and, at ``--dim 2``, scores
against ground truth and saves a [GT | prediction | error] figure on the Poincaré disk, same as
``--dim 2`` does for torus/sphere on their own charts. See hyperbolic_TODO.md's "Known issue" note
on a residual, occasional NaN risk in long training runs (same risk class already documented for
sphere+srm/weak_supervision+srm elsewhere in this codebase, not unique to this environment).

Points on ``H^n`` are unit-timelike vectors in R^{n,1}: ``x`` with Minkowski square
``<x,x>_eta = -1`` and ``x[-1] > 0`` (the upper sheet), signature ``eta = diag(1,...,1,-1)``
(last coordinate timelike). This is the direct analog of ``SphereEnvironment``'s ambient
unit-vector representation (``<x,x> = +1`` in R^{n+1}, Euclidean signature) with the Minkowski
form and hyperbolic trig (``cosh/sinh/arccosh``) standing in for the sphere's circular trig.

Unlike S^n, H^n has no cut locus (it's simply connected and non-positively curved — Cartan–
Hadamard), so the log map and its Jacobian are smooth everywhere: no antipodal clipping is
needed, and the tangent frame only needs one reference point (the apex), not two (contrast
``_sphere_frame``'s near-antipodal fallback).

The tangent-frame construction (``_lorentz_frame``) and the wrapped-density machinery this
feeds (``srms/lib/manifold_splat.py``'s ``eval_wrapped_gaussian``) follow Nagano, Yamaguchi,
Fujita & Koyama, *"A Wrapped Normal Distribution on Hyperbolic Space for Gradient-Based
Learning"* (ICML 2019) — the hyperbolic analog of the Said et al./Chevallier et al. sphere
construction already cited there.

    ``domain_radius`` plays the torus's ``[-π,π)^dim`` / the sphere's whole-S^n role).

    Obstacles are capsule-thickened geodesic rays (not balls, unlike torus/sphere): each ray
    originates at a point sampled within ``domain_radius`` of ``start`` and continues *outward*

    large. See hyperbolic_TODO.md's "Ray obstacles" section for the derivation and the earlier
